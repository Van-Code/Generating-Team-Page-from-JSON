# Generating-Team-Page-from-JSON
Build a team page with individual photos, names and title from JSON file

This is an example of how I generated the team section of a company page. I used PHP to read through JSON containing the employees. 

The JSON file contains the file name for two photos for each employee as well as their name and department. On the initial view, you see the employee's default photo. On hover, you see a funny face photo with the employee's name and department. 

I stripped the code from the site to show work.
